# Edin improvements

I love the free [Edin theme](https://theme.wordpress.com/themes/edin/) for [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com). However I have found I need to make the same tweaks to it every time I use it. This repository keeps that all in one place, mainly for my convenience.

The child theme and all instructions below have been tested with Edin version 1.2.2.

## Install child theme

Install my [Edin child theme](https://github.com/austinjp/edin-child-theme). This does a few things:

1. Replaces thumbnail images on the "grid" page with a transparent PNG, and instead displays the featured image as a background image lement. This allows alignment far more easily using `background-position` in HTML/CSS.
2. Set a "focal point" for featured images, using a custom field `image_focus`. This is used by the "grid" page, and the "hero" elements.

## Remove front-page URL from sub-page URLs

Edin's grid layout is a good choice for a front page. Create a page, call it "front page" or similar, and change it to type "Grid". Go to "Settings > Reading" and use that page as a static front page. Create new pages with the front page as a parent. They should now appear as items in a grid on the front page.

However the grid layout requires making sub-pages, which Wordpress gives URLs like `http://www.example.com/front-page/sub-page` whereas I prefer `http://www.example.com/sub-page`. Fortunately this is simple to fix by installing the [Custom Permalinks plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-permalinks/). After installing check "Settings > Permalinks" are set to "Post name" and ensure `.htaccess` is writable.

## Remove page titles

Install the [Toggle the Title](https://wordpress.org/plugins/toggle-the-title/) plugin. This removes titles from pages, but not posts. It actually removes the HTML rather than just hiding it with CSS. In "Settings > Title Toggler" set it to remove all titles from all pages.

## Retain HTML in grid page article items

Edin uses "the_excerpt" in Wordpress which removes HTML tags from the snippets displayed in the grid page. The child theme allows HTML, but removes shortcodes, thereby permitting styling of excerpts when displayed in the "grid" page.

## Align images

In any page add a custom field called "image_focus". Set the value to be any valid `background-position` CSS value e.g. `top left` or `center right` etc. This will be used by the "grid" page and "hero" elements to ensure that the focal point of any image is kept in the frame when a featured image is cropped.

Th thumbnail images are aligned by plain HTML+CSS generated by the child theme. The hero background image is not as simple to modify, because the Edin theme is not easily "pluggable", so this is achieved by using JavaScript to dynamically insert some inline CSS.

## Alter text in footer

Footer text mentioning Edin and Wordpress is removed by the child theme.
